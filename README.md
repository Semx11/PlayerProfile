# PlayerProfile
This is a Forge mod for 1.8-1.8.9.
When you are on Hypixel in a lobby, you can hold sneak + right click on a player to view their profile, which got added in the Social Update on 18-7-2017.

It's a small mod, but it's a good mod to learn from. It should be fairly easy to understand what it does and how it works.
